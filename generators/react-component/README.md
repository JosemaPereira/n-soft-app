# Create new React Dumb Component

* At the root of your project run command

``` bash
$ yarn generate
```

* Pick up `react-component` option and fill the prompts.

* When asked for `Target path root for components directory` use an absolute path to the directory that contains your dumb components directory.

That's it happy component generating
